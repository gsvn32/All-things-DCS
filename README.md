* Nikhil: Master includes functions to query data from two workers (worker-am and worker-nz) using XMLRPC, and check the status of the workers. It also includes functions to create and monitor worker processes, as well as a Query class that processes user requests. The class can process three types of requests: requesting information on a person by name, or requesting information on a person who lived in a certain location or requesting information on a person who lived in a certain location and year.
+ Nikhil: Worker sets up an XML-RPC server to handle requests for data stored in a JSON file. The script creates a request queue with a maximum size of 20 and a request worker thread that processes requests from the queue. The server has three methods for getting data: getbyname, getbylocation, and getbyyear, which take arguments and return matching records from the JSON data. The handle_request method puts a request in the queue and waits for a response using a response queue. The is_queue_full method checks whether the request queue is full. The load_data function loads the JSON data from a file into memory. The script takes two command-line arguments: the port number for the server and the name of the data group to load.
